cd ~
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
Run the script under sudo:

sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
This will add the PPA and the local package cache will be updated automatically. After running the setup script you can then install Node.js like this:

sudo apt install nodejs
Now check your Node.js version to make sure it works with:

nodejs -v
Output:

v8.12.0
And check NPM version too:

npm -v
Output:

6.4.1
For some npm packages to work (compiling from source, for example) you’ll need the build-essential package.

Install with:

sudo apt install build-essential
Now you have Node.js and NPM working you can move on to install Gatsby.

Install Git and Gatsby CLI
To install Gatsby you’ll first need to have the git package installed:

sudo apt install git
The Gatsby CLI tool enables you to create new sites, and run commands for developing Gatsby sites. It’s a published npm package you can easily install using the following command:

sudo npm install --global gatsby-cli
Check Gatsby installed properly with:

gatsby -v
Output:

2.4.2
Now Gatsby is installed you can create your first Gatsby test site:

gatsby new hello-world https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
This command created a directory called hello-world and downloaded the test site to it, you can now run the starter site with:

cd hello-world
gatsby develop
Your Gatsby site is now running at http://localhost:8000 and should output Hello world!

OR

If you’re running Gatsby remotely you might want it on all IP addresses at port 80, do that with:

cd hello-world
gatsby develop -H 0.0.0.0 -p 80
